## Content
This is a template for writing high energy physics papers. It contains a simple
Makefile, and a script citations.py, which fetches the BibTeX bibliography from
InspireHEP, provided that you use their citation keys.

You can use citations.py stand-alone if you want. Call python citations.py --help
to see what it does.

No guarantees for correctly formatted manuscripts. Questions about LaTeX should 
go to someone else.
